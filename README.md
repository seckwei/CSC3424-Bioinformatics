# Genetic Material and Genomes (6/2 - 7/2)

## The Structure of a Genome (17)

- Single operational units, Operons
    - a unit made up of linked genes which is thought to regulate other genes responsible for protein synthesis

## (19)

- Exons
    - a segment of a DNA or RNA molecule containing information coding for a protein or peptide sequence.

- Introns
    - a segment of a DNA or RNA molecule which does not code for proteins and interrupts the sequence of genes.
    - [What is known about the function of introns, the nonencoding sequences in genes?](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-is-known-about-the-f/#)

## DNA Packaging (22)

- Histones
    - any of a group of basic proteins found in chromatin.
    - Histones are alkaline (basic pH) proteins. They are found inside the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. Their function is to package DNA into structural units called nucleosomes. Histones are the main proteins in chromatin. Chromatin is a combination of DNA and protein which makes up the contents of a cell nucleus. Because DNA wraps around histones, they also play a role in gene regulation. [[read more](http://study.com/academy/lesson/histones-function-types-quiz.html)]

- What 3 levels of organisation and packing?
    1. Neucleosome, simplest packaging structure of DNA that is found in all eukaryotic chromosomes; DNA is wrapped around an octamer of small basic proteins called histones; 146 bp is wrapped around the core and the remaining bases link to the next nucleosome; this structure causes negative supercoiling
    2. 30nm fiber, solenoid structure
    3. 700nm structure, in metaphase chromosomes [[source](https://www.ndsu.edu/pubweb/~mcclean/plsc431/eukarychrom/eukaryo3.htm)]

## Structure of Genes (25)

- Gene vs Genome
    - "Gene" refers to a specific sequence of DNA on a single chromosome that encodes a particular product. The word "genome" encompasses the entire set of genetic information across all 23 chromosome pairs, including all genes, as well as gene-modifying sequences, and all the stuff in-between.

- A gene can be considered to include its _adjacent regulatory region(s)_
    - An operon is made up of several structural genes arranged under a common promoter and regulated by a common operator. It is defined as a set of adjacent structural genes, plus the adjacent regulatory signals that affect transcription of the structural genes. The regulators of a given operon, including repressors, corepressors, and activators, are not necessarily coded for by that operon. The location and condition of the regulators, promoter, operator and structural DNA sequences can determine the effects of common mutations. [[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operon)]
